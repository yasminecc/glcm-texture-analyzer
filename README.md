# GLCM Texture Analyzer

This C++ program calculates texture features of an image matrix using the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). It outputs:
- Contrast
- Energy
- Homogeneity

The user provides a text file containing grayscale image data, and the program generates the GLCM with direction θ = 0 and distance d = 1, then computes normalized values and the texture statistics.
